            Hello, I am Moshi Li, and I like creating things. I found my
            interest in putting things together at an early age when I was
            introduced to Mini 4WD and Lego. During my undergraduate computer
            science program at{" "}

            , I grew a passion for web development through courses and group
            projects.
