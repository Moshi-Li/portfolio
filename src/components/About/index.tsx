          Hi there, my name is Moshi and I like to build all kinds of things. I
          specialize in front end development and have completed many back end
          tasks as well when needed. My passion as a front end developer is to
          bring ideas to reality with excellent usability, creative aesthetics
          and a lot of polish â€“ all in the name of offering fluid and pleasing
          experiences for users.
          <br />
          <br /> But most importantly, I have been a soccer fan for decades and
          I never take myself too seriously.
          <br />
